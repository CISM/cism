Slab test case
==============

WARNING: THIS TEST CASE IS IN DEVELOPMENT AND HAS NOT BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATED.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!


This directory contains python scripts for running an experiment involving a
uniform and infinite ice sheet ("slab") on an inclined plane.

The test case is described in sections 5.1-2 of:

Blatter-Pattyn First-order solution is described in J.K. Dukowicz, manuscript
in preparation.
