====================
EISMINT-2 test cases
====================

To run a particular test case, first create a symbolic link (or copy of) your
executable, e.g.:

```sh
ln -s ../../../builds/mac-gnu/cism_driver/cism_driver
```

For a serial build, EISMINT-2 test A can be run using:

```sh
./cism_driver e2.a.config
```

For a parallel build, one would use:

```sh
mpirun -np 1 ./cism_driver e2.a.config
```

and likewise for other test cases.

Note that some tests use output "hotstart" files (marked with a "hot"
exentsion) from previous tests as input files, so the tests should be run
sequentially, starting with test A.

To view the results use ncview or another utility for viewing netCDF files.
