Introduction
------------
This module contains a f95 implementation of the exact solutions for 
isothermal ice sheet models developed by Ed Bueler et al [1]. The f95 code
is based on their matlab code which is included in this module with their 
agreement.

Compilation
-----------
As of 2014, compilation/automatically running these tests is no longer supported.  
The instructions below for "Running the Test Suite" are left for
reference only, but the instructions are no longer supported and likely no longer work.
The Makefile.am files located in this directory and its subdirectories 
were used by the Autotools build system which is
no longer used by CISM.  The Makefile.am files have been left for 
reference only.

Running the Test Suite
----------------------
Running the entire test suite for all resolutions takes quite some time. If 
you are willing to wait you can just run
make png
in the tests directory. Alternatively, you can run individual tests using the
run_verif.py script. Run "run_verif.py -h" for a list of options.

Licensing
---------
The code is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. A copy of the GPL
is included in this module. See the file COPYING.
