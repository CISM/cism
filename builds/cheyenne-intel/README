This directory contains posix-compliant CMake build scripts (*-cmake.sh) and
shell agnostic build scripts (*-cmake), which are mostly intended for csh/tcsh
users. 

The posix scripts are recommended because they support out of source builds by
using the first command-line argument to set the (top-level) CISM source
directory. For example, to build in this directory, you may run the command:

source PLATFORM-COMPILER-cmake.sh

Likewise, if your CISM source is located in $CISM, you may build in a $BUILD
subdirectory by:

mkdir -p $BUILD && cd $BUILD source
$CISM/builds/PLATFORM-COMPILER/PLATFORM-COMPILER-cmake.sh $CISM

This functionality is necessary for using the build and test structure (BATS,
located in $CISM/tests/regression/), will allow you to build multiple versions
of CISM for testing, and make cleaning up the build directory easier.

Because there isn't a reasonable way to make out-of-source capable build
scripts work across both posix-compliant shells (sh, bash, zsh, etc.) and
non-compliant shells (csh, tcsh), a shell agnostic build script is also
available for csh/tcsh users. 

NOTE: If you edit one of these script, please reflect your changes in the other
script! 

WARNING: It is possible these scripts will have diverged, so if you're having
build problems, first check the differences between the two scripts.
