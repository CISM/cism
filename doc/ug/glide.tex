\section{GLIDE}
GLIDE is the actual ice sheet model. GLIDE comprises three procedures which initialise the model, perform a single time step and finalise the model. The GLIDE configuration file is described in Section \ref{ug.sec.config}. The GLIDE API is described in Appendix \ref{ug.sec.glide_api}. The simple example driver explains how to write a simple climate driver for GLIDE. Download the example from the GLIMMER website or from CVS:

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Configuration}\label{ug.sec.config}
The format of the configuration files is similar to Windows \texttt{.ini} files and contains sections. Each section contains key, values pairs.
\begin{itemize}
\item Empty lines, or lines starting with a \texttt{\#}, \texttt{;} or \texttt{!} are ignored.
\item A new section starts with the the section name enclose with square brackets, e.g. \texttt{[grid]}.
\item Keys are separated from their associated values by a \texttt{=} or \texttt{:}.
\end{itemize}
Sections and keys are case sensitive and may contain white space. However, the configuration parser is very simple and thus the number of spaces within a key or section name also matters. Sensible defaults are used when a specific key is not found.

NetCDF I/O can be configured in the main configuration file or in a separate file (see \texttt{ioparams} in the \texttt{[options]} section). Any number of input and output files can be specified. Input files are processed in the same order they occur in the configuration file, thus potentially overwriting priviously loaded fields.
